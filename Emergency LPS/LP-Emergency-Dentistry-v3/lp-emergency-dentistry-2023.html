                <h2>Most Common Dental Emergencies</h2>
                <p>We understand. Dental emergencies are tough to predict, and it is even more difficult to figure out what is causing the pain. Because we handle more emergencies in a month than many dentists see in a year, we can find solutions quickly. We start with a same-day appointment, and your visit will include a thorough exam and the necessary x-rays. Most importantly, we will treat you with respect and get you back on a path to a healthy, beautiful smile.  Call now to schedule your same-day appointment.</p>
